## How it works

A half adder is a basic combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary inputs, A and B, and produces two outputs: the sum and the carry. The sum is obtained using an XOR gate, since XOR outputs 1 only when the inputs are different. The carry is obtained using an AND gate, because a carry is generated only when both inputs are 1. Thus, the half adder can handle simple one-bit addition but cannot account for a carry-in from a previous stage, which is why it is called “half” and not a full adder.

## How to test

|A	|B	|SUM	|CARRY |
|---|---|-----|------|
|0	|0	|0	  |0     |
|0	|1	|1	  |0     |
|1	|0	|1	  |0     |
|1	|1	|0	  |1     |
